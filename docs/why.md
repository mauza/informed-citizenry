# Why We Exist

## The Problem

Most citizens are disconnected from the legislative process that shapes their lives. Here's why:

- **Complexity**: Bills are written in dense legal language that requires expertise to understand
- **Volume**: Thousands of bills are introduced each legislative session
- **Transparency Gap**: It's hard to track how representatives actually vote vs. what they promise
- **Time**: Busy lives make it difficult to stay informed about every issue

This disconnect leads to:
- Uninformed voting decisions
- Representatives voting against constituent interests without accountability
- Civic disengagement and apathy
- Special interests having outsized influence

## Our Mission

**Empower every citizen with clear, actionable information about legislation and representation.**

We believe:
- Democracy works best when citizens are informed
- Understanding legislation shouldn't require a law degree
- Representatives should be accountable to their constituents
- Technology can bridge the gap between complex government data and citizen understanding

## Core Values

### Transparency
All data is sourced from official government records. We show our work—every score, summary, and analysis is traceable to its source.

### Accessibility
Information should be free and easy to understand. We use AI to translate legalese into plain English and present data in intuitive formats.

### Non-Partisanship
We don't take policy positions. We present facts—how bills affect citizens, how representatives vote, and how well those votes align with constituent views.

### Privacy
User data is protected. We only collect what's necessary to provide the service, and we never sell user information.

## How We Help

### For Citizens
- **Understand bills quickly** with AI-generated summaries
- **Track issues you care about** across the legislative session
- **See how your representatives vote** on those issues
- **Measure representation quality** through data-driven scores
- **Make your voice heard** by recording your stance on bills

### For Democracy
- **Increase accountability** by making voting records visible and understandable
- **Bridge the information gap** between government actions and citizen awareness
- **Enable data-driven civic engagement** rather than soundbite-driven reactions
- **Support informed participation** in local, state, and eventually federal politics

## Why This Matters Now

- **Information overload**: Traditional news can't cover every bill
- **Polarization**: Facts and data can cut through partisan narratives
- **Technology readiness**: AI can now process and explain complex documents at scale
- **Civic urgency**: Democracy requires an informed citizenry to function

## The Long-Term Vision

We envision a world where:
- Every citizen can understand legislation affecting their lives
- Representatives are consistently accountable to their constituents
- Civic engagement is driven by facts and data
- Democracy is strengthened through transparency and accessibility

This starts with state legislatures. It grows from there.
